<h3>First Aid and CPR</h3>

<p>
    Knowing how to administer first aid and CPR can be life-saving skills. This page provides a brief overview of these techniques, but it is highly recommended to get certified through reputable organizations.
</p>

<h4>First Aid Basics</h4>
<p>
    First aid involves the immediate care given to someone who is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. Here are some basic steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Assess the Situation:</strong> Ensure the scene is safe for you and the injured person.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Responsiveness:</strong> Gently shake the person and ask loudly, "Are you okay?"</li>
    <li><strong>Call for Help:</strong> If the person is unresponsive or seriously injured, call emergency services (911 in the US).</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Breathing:</strong> Look, listen, and feel for breathing.</li>
    <li><strong>Control Bleeding:</strong> Apply direct pressure to wounds with a clean cloth.</li>
    <li><strong>Treat for Shock:</strong> Keep the person warm and lying down.</li>
</ul>

<h4>CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) Basics</h4>
<p>
    CPR is an emergency procedure that combines chest compressions and artificial ventilation to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Check for Responsiveness and Breathing:</strong> If the person is not responsive and not breathing or only gasping, proceed with CPR.</li>
    <li><strong>Call for Help:</strong> If someone else is available, have them call 911. If you are alone, call 911 yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Chest Compressions:</strong> Push hard and fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.</li>
    <li><strong>Rescue Breaths:</strong> After every 30 chest compressions, give two rescue breaths. Tilt the head back, lift the chin, pinch the nose, and give a full breath, watching for the chest to rise.</li>
    <li><strong>Continue CPR:</strong> Keep performing chest compressions and rescue breaths until help arrives or the person shows signs of life.</li>
</ul>
